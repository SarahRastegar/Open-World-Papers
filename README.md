# Open World Papers

Current machine learning algorithms are bound to a closed-world assumption. This means that these models assume the number of categories the model will encounter in the test time is predefined. However, this assumption needs to be revised in the real world. There are many challenges associated with the real-world setting that traditional machine learning models can not resolve. The uncertainty a model can encounter during test time and the strategy to address it have been considered recently under different computer vision branches. 

| **Problem Name**       | **Test categories** | **Problem Goal** |
|---------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Zero-shot Recognition| Unseen - Known | Clarify if a sample has which unseen category |
| Generalized Zero-shot Recognition| Unseen 
and Seen - Known | Detect the category (seen or unseen) of a test sample|
| Open-set Recognition| | Unseen 
and Seen - Known | Detect the category (seen or unseen) of a test sample|
| Open-world Learning| Unseen 
and Seen - Known | Detect the category (seen or unseen) of a test sample|
| Novel Class Discovery | Unseen 
and Seen - Known | Detect the category (seen or unseen) of a test sample|
| Generalized Category Discovery | Unseen 
and Seen - Known | Detect the category (seen or unseen) of a test sample|
